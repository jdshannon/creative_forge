# üìú Ikigai App Constellation ‚Äî Technical Document

This document defines the **structure, schema, and relationships** of the Ikigai App Constellation. It is intended as a foundation for development, ensuring all apps (the Six Relics) can share a common data model and ecosystem.

---

## üåå Overview

The Ikigai Constellation is composed of six modular apps (Forge, Loom, Ledger, Compass, Chalice, Anvil). Each connects to a shared backend, centered on **Ideas** and **Projects**. Supporting entities (Reflections, Lore, Mechanics, Materials, Quests) extend functionality specific to each app.

---

## üõ† Platform Strategy

- **Primary Platform:** Mobile-first (Android/iOS).
- **Secondary Platform:** Web/desktop for deep creative work.
- **Optional:** Progressive Web App (offline-capable).

**Frontend:** Flutter or React Native.

**Backend:** Firebase or Supabase (real-time sync + auth).

**Design:** Offline-first, with local storage + cloud sync.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Development Phases

**Phase 1: Core Foundations**
- Implement Users, Ideas, Projects, Reflections.
- Build Forge (capture) + Compass (reflection).

**Phase 2: Creative Tools**
- Expand with Story Loom (Lore) and Maker‚Äôs Ledger (Materials).

**Phase 3: Playful Expansion**
- Add Muse‚Äôs Companion (Quests) + Gamecrafter‚Äôs Anvil (Mechanics).

**Phase 4: Integration**
- Cross-link modules, shared dashboards, AI assist.

## üèó Guiding Principle

All six relics (apps) share a **unified schema**. Data is never siloed: every spark of inspiration (Idea) can find a home in multiple projects, cross mediums, and feed into daily reflection. This ensures the constellation works as **one living ecosystem**, not six separate tools.
